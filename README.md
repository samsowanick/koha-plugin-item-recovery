**Fast-Add Recovery Tool** (FART) is a plugin for Koha that allows library staff to recover items that have been deleted by searching Barcodes. This tool recovers the item record and bibliographic record (if one does not already exist) from the deleteditems, deletedbiblio, deletedbiblioitems, and deletedbiblio_metadata DB tables in Koha. Lastly it calls a reindexing of all items. To use; install the plugin, run tool, search for a list of barcodes to recover (limit 100).
